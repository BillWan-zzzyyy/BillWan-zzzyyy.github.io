Hello there!🤺 

I am an incoming **Ph.D. student** in the ​Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). I will join [Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/) at UW-Madison in Fall 2025 under the guidance of [Dr. Sikai (Sky) Chen](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/people/). Hope to see you soon in Madison!🥳

Before joining UW-Madison, I obtained my M.S. in Transportation Engineering at [College of Transportation](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University in 2025, and my B.E. in Vehicle Engineering at [Institute of Rail Transit](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), Tongji University in 2022. I am very fortunate and honored to be advised by Assoc.Prof. [Hechao Zhou](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10933.htm) and Prof. [Jimin Zhang](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/c5/e6/c4609a50662/page.htm) during my study at Tongji University. 🫶🫶

At Sky-Lab, my research seeks to accelerate the development of future intelligent transportation technologies. 🧐Specifically, I focus on: 
- **Autonomous driving**
- **Human-centered AI in autonomous systems**
- **Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)**

An equally important dimension of my work is to validate our methods through **real‑vehicle testing**: I have contributed to the development of [SkyDrive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18010) — a simulation platform at Sky-Lab for socially‑aware and human‑AI collaborative future transportation.
