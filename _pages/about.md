Hello there!ðŸ¤º 

I am an incoming PhD student in the [â€‹Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/) (CEE) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). I will join [Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/) at UW-Madison in Fall 2025 under the guidance of [Dr. Sikai (Sky) Chen](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/people/). Hope to see you soon in Madison!ðŸ¥³

As for now, I am pursuing an M.E in Transportation Engineering at [College of Transportation](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University in Shanghai, China. Before that, I obtained my B.E in Vehicle Engineering at [Institute of Rail Transit](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm)  (Merged with the College of Transportation in 2024), Tongji University in 2022. I am very fortunate to be advised by Assoc.Prof. [Hechao Zhou](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10933.htm) and Prof. [Jimin Zhang](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/c5/e6/c4609a50662/page.htm) during my study at Tongji University.
