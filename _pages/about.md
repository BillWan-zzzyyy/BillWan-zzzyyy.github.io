Hello there!ü§∫ 

I am a **Ph.D. student** in the ‚ÄãDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the <img src="assets/img/uwmadison.png" width="14" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). I joined <img src="assets/img/skylab.png" width="33" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>[Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/) at UW-Madison in Fall 2025 under the guidance of Dr.[Sikai (Sky) Chen](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/people/). On Wisconsin!<img src="assets/img/bucky.png" width="15" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>

Before joining UW-Madison, I obtained my M.S. in Transportation Engineering at [College of Transportation](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), <img src="assets/img/tongji.png" width="22" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>Tongji University in 2025, and my B.E. in Vehicle Engineering at [Institute of Rail Transit](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), Tongji University in 2022. I am very fortunate and honored to be advised by Assoc.Prof. [Hechao Zhou](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10933.htm) and Prof. [Jimin Zhang](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/c5/e6/c4609a50662/page.htm) during my study at Tongji University. ü´∂

As for now, I am working to accelerate the development of future intelligent transportation technologies. üßêSpecifically, I focus on: 
- **Autonomous driving**
- **Human-centered AI in autonomous systems**
- **Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)**

An equally important dimension of my work is to validate our methods through **real‚Äëvehicle testing**: I have contributed to the development of <img src="assets/img/Sky-Drive.png" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>[SkyDrive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18010) ‚Äî a comprehensive test platform at Sky-Lab for future transportation.
