Hello there!ðŸ¤º 

I am an incoming PhD student in the [â€‹Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/) (CEE) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). I will join [Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/) at UW-Madison in Fall 2025 under the guidance of [Dr. Sikai (Sky) Chen](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/people/).

As for now, I am pursuing an M.E in Transportation Engineering at [College of Transportation Engineering](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University in Shanghai, China. I am very fortunate to be advised by Assoc.Prof. [Hechao Zhou](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10933.htm) and Prof. [Jimin Zhang](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/c5/e6/c4609a50662/page.htm) during my study at Tongji University.

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
