Hello there!🤺

I am a first-year **Ph.D. student** in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the `<img src="assets/img/uwmadison.png" width="14" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>`[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). I joined `<img src="assets/img/skylab.png" width="33" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>`[Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/) at UW-Madison in Fall 2025 under the guidance of Dr.[Sikai (Sky) Chen](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/people/). On Wisconsin!`<img src="assets/img/bucky.png" width="15" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>`

Before joining UW-Madison, I obtained my M.S. in Transportation Engineering at [College of Transportation](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), `<img src="assets/img/tongji.png" width="22" height="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>`Tongji University in 2025, and my B.E. in Vehicle Engineering at [Institute of Rail Transit](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), Tongji University in 2022. I am very fortunate and honored to be advised by Prof. [Hechao Zhou](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10933.htm) and Prof. [Jimin Zhang](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/c5/e6/c4609a50662/page.htm) during my study at Tongji University. 🫶

As for now, I am working to accelerate the development of future intelligent transportation technologies. 🧐 Specifically, I focus on:

- **Autonomous driving**
- **Vision-Language-Action model**
- **Intelligent transportation systems**

An equally important dimension of my work is to validate autonomous driving related methods through **real‑vehicle testing**: I have contributed to the development of `<img src="assets/img/Sky-Drive.png" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 2px;"/>`[SkyDrive](https://github.com/BillWan-zzzyyy/Sky-Drive), an open source multi-agent platform for future transportation system and autonomous driving by Sky-Lab.
